# developers-together
The Github Repo of "Developers Together" - Rachit's Programming Community on Discord (https://discord.gg/YWcSw9mYHg)

# How to contribute?
The expectation is that the community members will be raising Pull Requests and making the repo useful.    
Agenda for the repo:
1. List of good questions If you did 10 problems and you really liked them, raise a PR with the list of those questions and short story of "what changed before and after doing these problems"
2. List of awesome project ideas If you built a cool project, raise a PR with the project name, link to its Github repo and its tech stack.

✅ We will be heavily using markdown  to maintain the repository neatly.   
✅ Raise a PR first, do not worry about the project structure at the moment.    
✅ We can work those details out in code reviews.
